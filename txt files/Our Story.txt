<H1> About </h1>
<p>Promoting Outdoor Adventures & Contributing To a Sustainable Future

Founded in March of 2017 and based in Sacramento, California, Outdoor Ideals is a community of adventure seekers who are striving to live a fit and active lifestyle amongst the beauty of our environments.

Whether you're thinking of taking a hike for the day, embarking on a journey to a National Park across state, or anything in between; we want to inspire you to take that step and document your outdoor journey for the world to see. 

While we all know how much landscape there is to explore, there still is a looming problem facing our environment. Every year there is an estimated 3.5 to 7 billion trees cut down with leading causes being timber harvesting, agriculture expansion, and wildfires. Numbers like these cannot be sustainable and consequently our future generations may not get the same sights and explorations. 

Therefore, in order to give back to the place we call home, Outdoor Ideals will have one tree planted in North America for every item purchased with the help from our partners at One Tree Planted.

With your help not only can we create a healthy lifestyle for ourselves but also a sustainable future for our planet.
